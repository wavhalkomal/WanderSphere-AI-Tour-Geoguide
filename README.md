## Project Description:
WanderSphere is an innovative AI-powered tour guide designed to recommend personalized travel destinations and experiences in real-time based on the sentiment analysis of user feedback, reviews, and social media data. The system uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time sentiment from multiple sources, enabling travelers to receive dynamic, sentiment-driven recommendations.


## Objective:
The main goal of this project is to create a recommendation system that adapts to user preferences, mood, and sentiment, offering travel suggestions that align with individual tastes and real-time emotions. It uses user-generated data from travel platforms, social media, and other sources to generate highly relevant travel recommendations that evolve dynamically.
